# Clipboard Image Text Extractor

This is a simple flask app that uses pytesseract to extract text from an image from the clipboard. It's containerized with docker so that you don't have to have pytesseract installed on your machine.

## Usage

1. Copy an image to your clipboard
2. Run the docker container
3. Visit `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser

## Running the app

- Dev Mode

```bash
docker compose watch
```

- Production Mode

```bash
docker compose up
```
